## Overview

OptimizeImage is a php class which enables any image within any subfolder to be resized to any proportion. Images won't be stretched (by default) and are cached. The script is unobtrusive; no modification is necessary to the storage location and/or uri of an image and the script only runs when query string parameters are added to an image uri.

## Installation

Copy the files class.resize.php, .htaccess and resize.php and the cache folder to any folder within your website root. If there is already a .htaccess file, add the contents of the new .htaccess file to the end of the existing file.
You will now be able to append width, height, quality and mode to the url and the image displayed will be resized as expected.
